                according to the diverse landscapes and regions of the country.
                The environmental, geographic, and cultural diversity within
                this vast area has led to a wide variety of dishes. Saudi Arabia
                encompasses different regions, resulting in cuisines from the

    title: "What Makes for a Great Restaurant Experience?",
    content: `Do today’s restaurant consumers want great convenience or a
                great experience? The answer … both. Technomic analysis shows
                consumers still value experience, even at a time when more than
                one-third of food purchased from restaurants is consumed
                elsewhere. With third-party delivery companies handling billions
                in sales, fine dining grew at a quicker pace than any other
                restaurant segment in 2018, and is projected to lead again in
                2019. Such seemingly conflicting data tells a broader story:
                experience matters, but the definition of what constitutes a
                great experience is evolving.`,
